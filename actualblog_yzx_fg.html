<br><br><p>*</p>
<p>The rain seems to pour endlessly down the shoulder, drip and drop to the ground while dragging incessant lines of wet. Skies were dark, greyish as it had been these past few days, murky with the dust and smog of a broken city. Cars honking, motorbikes beeping, people clambering, the noise seems to envelop the body, conceal vapid emptiness.<br>The figure stood there, silent and unwavering. One beat. Two beats. Three –<br>“Are you alright?” A voice said silently.<br>“...” No. “Yes, I’m all right. Don’t worry about me.”<br>“Don’t you have an umbrella?” Said the voice again, mellow with concern.<br>“No, I forgot to put it into my bag.”<br>“... There’s some shelter over there, if you want.”<br>“It’s fine. I like to shower in the rain sometimes.” Silence as the rain continues to pour.</p>
<p>The person stood there, with the other person, staring into some unknown distance. There seemed to be a common enjoyment of silence stretched between the two of them, like some shared melody of melancholy that might not be so sad as the rain originally made things out to be.</p>
<p>“How’s life?” The second person asked, crouching a bit to be at eye level with the first one.<br>“It’s alright.” The first person replied quietly. Silence continued to stretch. The rain filled up the empty holes left by the lack of conversation.<br>“And yours?” The first person added, like a little afterthought. The face turned a bit to face the other, head tilted to the side a bit to convey some sense of naive questioning.<br>“Ah, it’s OK.” That’s good to hear then. “So, just studying?” “Mostly, yea, that about sums it up.”<br>Another little pause.<br>“You plan on joining any projects or you’re just going with the usual?” The first person mumbled, a bit uncertain on whether the conversation was worth extending in the first place.<br>“I’m still thinking about it,” the second person mused absentmindedly. “I was thinking of joining some groups for fun, but I don’t really have time.”<br>“... Yea, that’s understandable.”</p> 
<p>Silence again. The pace of conversation stretched comfortably to accommodate for the drips of rain. Cars honking, feet clad in fabric and plastic, walking … It seemed like it was peak hour. The sky might as well be black now, but as with all skies, it just ended up being a murky plum purple courtesy of the mock sodium-yellow lights of the streets.</p>
<p>“You … have anything planned for this evening?” The first person finally spoke, voice a little heavy.<br>“No.” The second person replied casually. “Hence why I’m here.”<br>“Yea, I’ve figured.” … The first person kept eyes on the roadview. “The rain sometimes feels so calming, don’t you think?”<br>“Yea,” the second person seemed to ponder a bit. “... You like standing like that? You might get a cold.”<br>“It’s fine. I should be strong enough to handle it.”<br>Silence. Everything paused for a moment, the road brimming with movement and life but it seemed like between the two of them, nothing moved. All the static-ness of this time condensed like thick ink, hung onto the two of their shoulders and weighed them down. At the same time, although none of them said anything, there was some excitement, silent buzzing and warmth beneath their feet the longer they stood next to each other, one with an umbrella and one without.</p>
<p>“You’d like my umbrella?” The second person said after a while of simply just standing.<br>“Keep it.” The first person kept eyes on the street. “Just keep yourself dry.”<br>“My pants are half wet already though, I don’t mind,” the second person’s eyes seemed to pierce the first person’s head. But the first person insisted on diverting eyes away.<br>“It’s fine,” the first person seemed to repeat for the umptieth time. Pondered for a moment. “You’d like to stand in shelter? Sorry for forcing you to stand out here.”<br>“No, I really don’t mind,” the second person replied. “Just a bit concerned with how wet you are right now.”<br>“Don’t worry about me, I’m fine.” The first person said again.<br>“If you insist.”
<p>Anxiety seemed to weigh on the first person’s stomach now. Unprompted, sick and nauseating. This conversation was supposed to be enjoyable. The rain was supposed to be relaxing. Ah, how awful. The second person … the first person wondered when the almost very-certain-to-happen screw up would come. Perhaps it would be very soon.</p>
<p>“I think I”ll go inside,” the first person seemed to choke on voice as the person mumbled – almost like a grumble. “Gotta keep some part of myself dry for the journey home, at least.”<br>“Ah,” the second person’s mind seemed elsewhere. “Sure. I’ll go with you.” The first person’s heart seemed to drop to the stomach, heavier and heavier. Truly the definition of lead …</p>
<p>“What time is it, do you have a watch?” The first person asked aloud. With an unwavering awareness that a watch is present on the wrist, but the person is clutching onto straws right now.</p>
<p>“Uh, I don’t, but I can check my phone,” the second person replied.</p> 
<p>Silence. It was so pervasive and repetitive, it did not seem comforting anymore.</p>
<p>“It’s 6 30,” the second person told the first.</p>
<p>“Thanks.” Another silence. “Do you plan to go back?” The first person said. They were standing under shelter. The second person had settled to sitting down on a nearby bench, eyes fixed on the phone – although the first person felt like the second might as well have a pair of eyes at the back of the head, with how much the first person felt exposed.</p>
<p>It felt like the brain was transparent, the first person mused. “Hm, yea,” the second person replied. Like the first person was being watched. “Are you?”</p>
<p>The first person’s throat clenched tightly, the anxiety flowing freely in the veins. “I’ll stay here.” As much as the first person would like to go with the second one, the person did not feel so willing to make things more awkward than this moment. “See you tomorrow then.” If the person would ever meet the second person again.</p>
<p>“See you,” the second person waved. “It’s been nice catching up with you.”</p>
<p>So now it was just the first person standing blankly in the shelter, staring into the rainy weather. The person wanted to go home. The person honestly would not mind – if only the person would have said things differently – if the person were to go back with the second person right now. It would have been silence again, as it always have been, and they would still have been in whatever social relationship they had been in so far, and nothing would have changed, but it would have been nice to just be with the second person and let that person determine where the conversation – if any at all – were to go. It would have been nice, no doubt.</p>
<p>The rain continued to pour. Cars, motorcycles, people – how strange. How crowded the streets were right now, it did not feel like a scene the first person would have associated with the second person at all. But nonetheless, it was a familiar scene, and the first person watched, as the rows and rows of vehicles moved bit by bit forward, slowed down tremendously by the jam at the front, rain just pouring on people’s ponchos and coloured helmets like little rocks, bullets. Every now and then there was the occasional honk. The first person looked up to then see the mock sodium-yellow lights again, blurred a little due to the rain and also the glistening drops clinging on the glasses. The shelter seemed to be a bus station, the first person now correctly registered for the first time. Huh. This was odd.</p>
<p>The first person turned to see a third person standing in front, staring into the distance, presumably also waiting for an unknown bus to come. Where am I, the first person wondered. Where am I?</p>
<p>It was not long before the first person jolted with how familiar the third person looked. The shoulder blades … the hair … the slouching figure, and the occasionally tapping right foot … The third person seemed to stare back at the first person, and it felt like the first person was being pierced by glasses-framed eyes. Eyes that were strict but a little soft, and sweetly warm, and lips that would have given a soft little smile, enough to make the first person’s heart melt –</p>
<p>If the third person was who the first person thought of as, really. The third person did not look back.</p>
<p>The silence continued to pierce the air, only now that its normalcy started to come back. The first person had eyes locked on the third person’s gestures as the person checked their phone, then looked at the streets, and even occasionally leaned forward, looking left and right for any sign of bus. After a while, seemingly out of resignation, the person seemed to sigh a bit, before quietly turning back – oh – to sit on the bench with the first person, with considerable distance between the two of them. Unlike with the second person, the first person now felt no need to start any banter. But it left the first person almost aghast with a little shock.</p>
<p>Those were glasses. And the scent left behind was the shampoo that the third person had seemingly used before they went separate ways. Life has seemingly wonderful ways to make up for the lack of togetherness, the lack of any meetup or any greeting that had transpired for a horrible 2-and-a-half years or so.</p>
<p>The two of them just sat there, in the silence, as the rain continued to pour in front of them and the street continued with its hustle-and-bustle just as it always had. The rain now carried some gentle song – little whispers, that pierced the first person’s heart and gut with all the memories and recollections of events that once transpired, oh so indirectly, between them. All the happy and the sad seemed to flow endlessly with the crunchy sounds of showering rain, soft and melodic akin to the glassy and transparent Chopin pieces they used to play in cafés. The drops of water from the sky felt like crystals. Sad, piercing and cold, but beautiful like crystals.</p>
<p>The first person planned to open the mouth, only to again snap it shut. How was the third person? How was the third person’s life? Any achievements, tokens of happiness, any sad ones, miserable events? How was life? The first person yearned to ask again. But the first person again did not know whether the person could finish what had been started, if the mouth opened. But then again, there was nothing wrong with trying. So the first person opened the mouth again.<br>Then it closed with some hesitance. The person did not know what context should be used for this moment … unlike with the second person, the first person could not assume that the third one recognised the first.</p>
<p>Then the third person turned to look at the vehicles, it seemed, before directly turning to look straight at the first person’s likeness.</p>
<p>Silence as the first person drilled eyes on the streets. The person did not give away any signs of recognition, no, absolutely not.</p>
<p>There was an awkward pause, a very awkward one, before there was a soft voice coming from the direction of the third person.</p>
<p lang="vi-VN" xml:lang="vi-VN">“Bạn trông quen ấy nhỉ …”<br>“Hm?”<br>“Bạn trông quen.” The person’s voice trailed into the distance, a wisp of smoke, but the first person was determined to catch every decibel of it.</p>
<p lang="vi-VN" xml:lang="vi-VN">“Bạn lớp 11, đúng không?” The third person persisted, after a short pause.<br>“Ừ”, the first person hesitated. It seemed like the third person caught on.</p>
<p>Silence.</p>
<p lang="vi-VN" xml:lang="vi-VN">“X đấy hả?” The third person continued, the voice laced with some energy akin to that from surprise.<br>“Ừ,” the first person nodded. “Tao vừa mới về mấy ngày trước.” Context is needed to keep conversations going.<br>“Lâu rồi không gặp mày,” the third person seemed to muse. “Mày không hay về thì phải.”<br>“Ừ, tao bận.”<br>“Lần trước 20/11 mày không kịp về, đúng không?”<br>“Ừ, tao bận dự án của tao.”</p>
<p>Silence again. Was this conversation even worth continuing?</p>
<p lang="vi-VN" xml:lang="vi-VN">“Dạo này thế nào rồi?” The first person decided that the answer to that question would be a yes.<br>“Ổn.” A one-worded answer. “Mọi thứ thế nào thì vẫn thế đấy.”<br>“Nghe mày định ôn thi Toán cấp Quốc gia?” The first person tried to find something relevant to talk about.<br>“À, ừ,” the third person replied, with a little less enthusiasm. The subject matter seemed not to be a welcomed one.<br>Nonetheless, there were not many options. “Mày vẫn đang ôn hả, hay mày thi rồi?” The first person decided on saying this.<br>“Tuần trước thi rồi.”<br>“Khó quá không?”<br>“Quốc gia mà, khó chứ.” The third person paused a bit. “Thực ra, cũng không đến nỗi. Chắc lấy giải bạc được.”<br>“Không phải vàng nữa à?” The first person teased.<br>“Thôi,” the third person waved the hand dismissively. “Còn năm sau nữa mà.”<br>“Hệt như năm xưa ấy nhỉ?” The first person seemed to laugh a bit. “Hồi lớp 8 lớp 9 của mày ấy.”<br>The third person seemed to grimace, but there seemed to be a soft smile on the third person’s face. “Chậc, hồi đấy thì nhắc lại làm gì.”<br>“Nhắc lại chứ, nhớ nhất hồi đấy mà,” the first person grinned. “Thôi, tao đùa đấy.” An afterthought.</p>
<p>Soft silence again. The rain seemed to melt around them.</p>
<p lang="vi-VN" xml:lang="vi-VN">“Bên đấy học thế nào?” The third person’s turn.<br>“Cũng bình thường thôi,” the first person waved the hand, again quite dismissively. “Có gì thì lấy cơ hội làm đẹp hồ sơ thôi chứ cũng chẳng có gì đặc biệt.”<br>“Mày có thi học sinh giỏi bên đấy không? Hình như tao nghe mày được giải vàng cho cuộc thi nào đó thì phải.”<br>Ah. “À ừ, cái giải Junior Olympiad đấy.” The first person heaved a silent sigh. “Cái đấy thì nói làm gì. Định thi Hoá cấp Quốc gia năm sau, nhưng không biết đại diện nổi cho [...] mà đi thi Quốc tế hay không.”<br>“Mày giỏi thế, chắc cũng được gì đó thôi,” the third person replied, with the side of a laugh. “Chưa gì đã chảy máu chất xám thế này,” The person joked.<br>“Ô nhiễm thế này, ở lại làm gì,” the first person gestured vaguely at the bustling streets. “Mà còn mấy thằng kiểu V hay cái gì mà, thiếu gì người giỏi.”<br>“Nói thế thì nói làm gì,” the third person replied. The third person seemed more willing to converse than the person had been so many years ago. “Mà cũng ô nhiễm thật. Bụi vãi.”<br>“Chả ô nhiễm,” the first person spoke with newfound fire, “trông hệt như sương mù mà bảo không ô nhiễm mới lạ! Tụi mày đeo mặt nạ phòng độc đi là vừa.”<br>“Ờ, ờ,” the third person let out a little laugh. “Mà cũng khổ nỗi cho mày. Nghe con B bảo bên [...] sạch sẽ lắm mà?”<br>“Sạch chứ!” The first person found some energy the person did not know was there, “không khí mát mẻ trong lành khác hẳn ở đây. Về xong chỉ muốn quay lại!”<br>“Thế thì buồn quá,” the third person had a lilt of mocking in the voice, with a little wry smile to accompany it. “Cuối năm sau 20/11 mày định tạt về không?”<br>“Còn xem thế nào đã,” the first person turned to look into the distance. “Năm sau chắc bận túi bụi.” Silence. “Mày định về không?”<br>“Cũng còn tuỳ,” the third person clicked the tongue in some sense of doubt mixed with frustration, “đến lúc đấy lớp 12 bận tối cả mặt. Chẳng biết thế nào.”<br>“À, ừ, còn ôn thi nữa,” the first person nodded in agreement. “Mà nghe mấy đứa kia định thi SAT với IELTS đủ thứ, mày có định thi không?”<br>“Mẹ tao bắt tao thì tao thi, chứ tao kém tiếng Anh bỏ xừ,” the third person sighed rather heavily. “Thi chắc cũng chả được gì.”<br>“Nói thế thì chịu rồi,” the first person found some more energy to joke around. “Thi thì cứ thi, chứ muốn tốt lên thì phải ôn chứ.” The first person mused for a moment. “Thế lên đại học mày định ra nước ngoài không hay ở lại đây?”<br>The third person seemed to just stare at the first, before looking away, deep in thought. The person’s eyebrows scrunched together as the person said slowly, “tao không biết nữa.” A little pause, the first person planned to say something but the third person seemed to have not yet finished. “... Cũng có người bảo tao đi ra nước ngoài ấy, nhưng tiếng Anh tao kém nên tao định ở lại học nốt đi là vừa.”<br>“Bố mẹ thầy cô bảo mày ấy hả?”<br>“Ừ, thì chỉ có họ thôi chứ còn ai nữa?”<br>“À ừ …”</p>
<p>Silence dawned upon them again as the first person mulled over the conversation so far.</p>
<p lang="vi-VN" xml:lang="vi-VN">“Mày chờ xe buýt về nhà hả?” The first person finally decided that digging this far into the third person’s life was enough. Although people from this region tend to be more open to conversing and sharing personal details and stories, the first person did not yet feel ready to touch on all of that.<br>“Ừ. Mày?”<br>“Cũng thế.” The first person found the lie rather easy to fit on the lips.
“Mà sao xe buýt đến lâu thế nhỉ? Chờ từ nãy giờ …” the third person’s voice seemed to drift away into the rain that now came back into focus for the first person. The conversation was lively, very much so, more than the first person really expected.<br>“Chắc tắc đường,” the first person was deep in thought. <br>“Ờ, chắc vậy,” the third person looked to the streets along with the first person. Silence enveloped the both of them again.</p>
<p>It so seemed like a nice day, then. The flowers in the first person’s heart seemed to rejuvenate with renewed vigour, bloom in a new, happier, more hopeful colour … It had been a nice day.</p>
<p>The two people sat that way, for how long, the first person did not know. The flowers continued to shower warmth into the first person’s heart, like a rekindled fire … It seemed not so long ago when the first person was standing in front of a random school’s gates to wait for the third person, or when the first person was watching the third person play Chinese shuttlecock, or when the first person was watching the third person solving problems on the board. All of them felt like yesterday, a yesterday the first person may not be too hesitant to come back to, a yesterday that seemed like it still carried the miracle of happiness, a dawn of pure hope, and dreams, and sweet songs of an adolescence that went nowhere in the end, but nonetheless could be traced back to this. If the first person were like the person back then, the heart would be beating so intensely at this moment. The first person would have felt so elated. Much less was everything now, but the first person was happy to visit the old memories again. The person was, and would still be, very happy and honoured to be able to relive that old breathlessness, the wonder and the piercing hope that came with chasing a forever far-away star, a glint of light in the dark whose warmth the person could never reach.</p>
<p>The first person did not know when the third person left, not before waving a little at the first person, and the first person gladly reciprocated, in happy vigour, watching as that bus went away into the distance, and when the rain calmed down, when the streets slowed, became less crowded and less lively with people. When the entire world seemed to pause for the first person, the person sat in the so-called bus station with unrecognisable signs and symbols, and stayed there, wondering how the person got there, how the lights glowed so yellow and how the rain seemed so soft on the skin all the sudden. The world seemed a brighter, more yellow song – the flowers of the heart seemed to turn the yellow of Mai, and the skies – a soft rosy sheen, a grandiose and beautiful golden orange, not glittering but glowing softly the colour of new sun – brightened by a notch. Something seemed to lift. The pedals flew in the rib cage, and the stomach seemed to be free of the previous heaviness from the second person, and all seemed fine, all seemed fine like nothing happened and the pace of life could be just as it was, slow, soft, non-dramatic and fearless.</p>
<p>Of course it still rained, and of course the sky was still dark, but was it wrong to daydream of the old scenes, when things used to look grand, when hope was still as beautiful as it was without the little reminders, the clouds that slightly hinted at how far the sun is, and how easily it runs away from one’s “grasp”? The first person was tired at the implications, and the first person was sick of the tainted “hope”, although hope was still hope, dreams were still dreams, but apparently to the heart there was a “right” kind and of course a “wrong” kind. The more the first person stayed, the less easily the feeling came to the person.</p>
<p>And the elation – after a while it was gone. The sky was dark again, rain continued to rain, cold and unwavering. The first person felt a sickening feeling of guilt for the second person. Maybe the person should have paused a little bit, allowed the heart out of the “awkwardness” cage and into the freedom of conversation and maybe something else. The second person probably did not mean anything. That. It should be that, among anything else, and the first person should have nothing, nothing to indulge at all, considering the feelings of betrayal, and confusion, and fear –</p>
