<h2>25/12/24</h2>
<p>Your sibling had just been scolded, your head hurt from where they had hit you. Typical family event. You are picking up their toys, cleaning up their messes, because as the <i>diligent older sibling</i> you are, it is your responsibility to do those little things when your parents are too tired of their antics to do any chores.</p>
<p>Come to think of it, this was the first time you have felt so disappointed in your sibling. They had just done typical child things, after all. If you can call telling the neighbour to "shut up" during a visit or slapping your Dad typical. But to be fair, your standards have always been warped in some way. Your parents told you to go light on them since they are smaller than you are, but after events like these, you have found it harder to determine what to expect.</p>
<p>You could always put expectations at <i>rock bottom</i>, of course, but as a person your sibling looks up to, you should be setting some bar for them to follow and learn. Manners matter in life, after all. People would like you better if you are charming and slick.</p>
<p>You should probably start cleaning.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>You started folding the mountain of jackets, sweaters, socks and whatnot on your sofa. Your parents are rather busy, so they probably would not have time to sit and comb through every garment every time your sibling, or anyone else, decided to dig the pile up a bit to find some obscure cap or socks. You would rather drown yourself in your living room's worth of chores, after all. Doing so makes you feel a bit more <i>useful</i>.</p>
<p>With the lack of human presence, you would probably have been constructing some random scenario for your entertainment if today was any other average Tuesday. Or you could be humming some song with pitch so absurd your hum sounds more deranged than a goat's screech. Maybe you could accompany your journey-to-a-pocket-dimension experience with some acting, your lines obviously mouthed to maintain the silence. However, today was <i>Sunday</i>, and your brain perhaps felt more content dangling you in whatever sludge worth of feelings that it could construct - silent hums with the slow and dreary accompaniment of the constant ticking noise your wall clock was making. As if the wretched clock was inviting you to some sing-along.</p>
<p>In the midst of sorting the clothes, and panicking about how much you would have to do, you made the absolutely horrible mistake, of picking your Dad's jacket up. You were just planning to throw it to the side for a minute, but being the strange human being you are, you find yourself near the brink of tears.</p>
<p>Huh. <i>Misplaced oversensitivity</i>, said the only rational part of your brain.</p>
<p>Well, what was the last time you had seen this family happy?</p>
<p>And the sentence might as well have broken the dam on Yangtze River, because you are practically swimming in thought now. To say you <i>were never happy at all</i> would be a sad exaggeration, you were laughing your sanity out just this afternoon, and your sibling had hardly failed in making absolutely hilarious requests that tickle your little funny bone. And you were not feeling <i>nothing</i>, certainly not bored - there was nothing a little bit of studying could not fix. Perhaps you were upset. There were voices raised, after all. Certainly not out of the ordinary for your family, but you were rather out of element these past few weeks, so you could be a tad bit more forgiving with yourself. It is almost Christmas anyway, you could afford to be more easygoing for the sake of holiday spirit.</p>
<p>You just felt a bit tired with all the patching up you have to do, probably, all the cleaning up, the "shush" and the "hush", the screams of</p>
<p>"keep calm and move the fuck on."</p>
<p>Wholehearted self-restraint, one would call it, all for the sake of keeping the peace, holding the curtains steady. You were not seeing any bombshells, nor any flammable material, but the smell of red in the air was enough to send you up the wall. It only takes a single sentence, one button, for the Demon Core to evolve into a mushroom cloud.</p>
<p>You would have to fix your radar later. It went a little haywire. Surely the silence does not always mean anger?</p>
<p>The floorboards creaked behind you, the air heavy on your chest. You did not have to take a glance to know it was your Dad. Away he went, to the secluded window in the kitchen, checking the dish storage rack  and the pots on the kitchen counter filled with carefully cooked chicken or fish. A few minutes later, as the quiet resumed, you could already smell the bitter tobacco making its way into the crevices of your nasal cavity.</p>
<p>Well, you have given up on warning him about the potential risk of getting lung diseases. BoD.</p>
<p>&#x2605;&#24417;</p>
<p>Pressing down the last puffy jacket onto the tall stack of clothes sitting on the sofa corner, you turned to the miscellaneous items feigning benign on the family piano: files, papers, a roll of tape and a definitely-not-pig-shaped piggy bank that your sibling got for Christmas.</p>
<p>A new dilemma: the ceramic piggy bank, in all its miserable glory, was too fat to be put on top of the fridge or the clothes dryer - usual places to put stuff out of your sibling's reach. Worse, it should be cleared right away since your Dad was not particularly fond of putting anything on the precious piano. Unclear of what to do with the yellow thing, you fumbled around hilariously, timidly walking to the sofa and the humongous pile full of your Mom's possessions, before settling on a small corner atop a stack of carton boxes next to the piano. It was uncomfortably small, but the objects surrounding the corner made ample coverage.</p>
<p>Clearing out some of your sibling's playthings out of the way, you scrambled and repositioned yourself to maintain balance.</p>
<p>___________________</p>
<p>The high-pitched bong the ceramic item made with the piano body made every single one of your cells screech in horror. Your Dad was, to your dismay, still smoking near the kitchen window nearby - with all the thinking power your brain could muster in 1.5 seconds, you raised a shaky hand to muffle the vibrations the wooden piano was making. As if that would help.</p>
<p>Your Dad was still smoking. Thank goodness.</p>
<p>&#9834;</p>
<p>Gingerly, you moved on to the items atop the living room clothes drawer. There was lipstick, eyeshadow, tubes with all sorts of cream you did not bother knowing. Absurdly out of place was the globe your parents bought you back from elementary school, along with a torn yellow package that contained a brand new purse - presumably your Mom's. You were paid too little for cleaning all of this - screw that, you were not even paid. Nevertheless, you settled on the task anyway, as the <i>responsible child</i> you should be.</p>
<p>After reassembling the items a bit, your eyes scanned through a little macaron container holding blue - or rather, what used to be blue - paper roses. If your memory was not lying, you must have made them yourself two years ago. You picked the container up, looking through it for a split second before putting it down onto a nearby counter, as memories associated with the faded blue colour began to swirl.</p>
<p>You continued your cleaning job, stuffing papers randomly into the top drawer. At some point you would stumble on documents with your sibling's name on it, envelopes from school or the occasional art piece they made from their classes, leaving heavy pangs in your chest. Sentimental as you are, you are reminded of the <i>happy times</i> when your sibling was more well-behaved. Obviously, there are many factors to familial happiness, but your parents were certainly happier when they did not have to scream at your sibling every thirty minutes. Before your sibling turned two, your family of course still had problems of its own - but that, you could contain. Or at least try to endure for one or two hours before the explosion came. The clock might as well have been doing a countdown.</p>
<p>But when your sibling decided it was high time they <i>pulled profanities out of their limited vocabulary</i>, all you could do is clasp your hands together, and pray that some invisible being above would just shut them up before your parents caught wind of the sentence. You would try to get them to be quiet, to tell them to stop talking, or you would try to distract them, but they would end up yelling at whoever was unlucky enough to be near their vicinity.</p>
<p>And of course, you would have to listen to whatever your Dad decided would be good enough a scolding to yell back at them. Unfortunately, there usually was no winning side to the shouting match, as you were too busy being scared out of your wits. Deep down, you feel a little ashamed, and perhaps embarrassed, to be near two people with steam coming out of their ears. You would wish you could bury yourself, or dig a tomb six feet underground, even though you were well aware of how tall you are, and the fact that you looked like you were Medusa'd did not help. Sometimes, you would very much like to tell your sibling to actually shut up, or to cover their mouth, but that would be rude.</p>
<p>Anything for the silence. The lack of sound does not mean peace, in fact it only acts as a miserable imitation. With the clock ominously reminding you of the time you have left, it takes grit to continue pretending, but stopping would only send you into a dazed panic. You did not know why you were so scared of time. At some point you figured it out for yourself, but your heart has a tendency to forget, especially with its present giddiness. As if you were in a trance, your body is suspended in freefall, midair, free yet pushed down by some invisible force. That was probably gravity trying to root you into reality, allowing you to be perfectly aware all the while floating away. But you were not even floating either. Lead bricks were pressing on your chest. No, it must have been pent-up air, pressure build-up.</p>
<br>
<p>"When you're finished, please lock the door and turn the lights off," said a soft voice behind you. It was from your Dad, a low sound that swirled the air with heaviness. Being there, cleaning the pile of old trinkets felt like being in a funeral.</p>
<p>Your Dad quietly shut the wooden door near you with a soft <i>slid</i>. You continued your cleaning job, half of you just wanting to throw the plastic globe model somewhere to free up some space. The thing was sickeningly large, and your sibling would not find use for it at least in the next three years. However, its size meant that it had to stay, sadly. Just like everything else. You decided not to throw anything, except for some plastic scraps dismissible as trash.</p>
<p>You silently turned to the blue roses, abandoned atop the counter. The blue colour of the paper flowers had already faded into a bleak, ashen green, although the paper still retained most of its shape. You could see where you gave up on making the flowers look nice - where the petals were left uncut and hastily curled outwards. You had never been good at time-consuming, long term projects. You had already forgotten what the flowers were for, so you just assume they were probably made for some friend of yours.</p>
<p>The reminiscence almost sent you into a literal whirlwind. It was scary how long time had passed. Scary how far you have already gone from the <i>happy times</i>, when life was still a more creamy and warm yellow colour. Now, it felt as if you were already an adult, although you clearly are not. You lack experience. You lack sufficient emotions and knowledge to grasp the grown up perspective. You tend to overestimate your abilities, everything felt so easy, tasteless, lifeless, gray, incomprehensible, not worth comprehending, <i>pointless</i> -  yet you still manage to disappoint yourself along the way. Hypostress, which ends with resentment. You are not calm enough, calculated enough, to plan everything <i>right</i>. The parts you have done wrong, the aspects of your world you could have fixed, they tasted like unfiltered coffee with grounds. Definitely not the way you usually like to drink the beverage.</p>
<p>You feel suspended, upside-down, spiraling, your head might very well be juggling itself. It was unpleasant to be reminded of how close the next school year is. School life, home life, <i>life</i> had always been a game of catching up, proving yourself. You do not dare to think what would happen if you let yourself drop behind the competition, be forgotten. People talk to you about the increasingly more competitive job market, and from their description you seem to already be there in spirit. On edge, in suspension, a tightrope walk. You seem to be holding your breath for absolutely forever, anticipation, any moment now. The possibility of being left behind felt too terrifying for you to comprehend, the possibility of being useless and a nuisance. The pressure that comes with trying not to disappoint brings bitterness to the mouth.</p>
<p>&#9734;&#24417;</p>
<p>Your hand tastelessly let go of the plastic container, with the roses. At some point, getting to the other end of the high rope feels meaningless. Your feet are already becoming numb with the constant walking. Your body constantly on edge, you wonder whether you should stop. Fall, it will be all right. You let your colours slip your fingers, it is pointless to chase after them. &#x2605;&#24417;</p>
<p>But there are people who are cheering to see you reach the other end. You do not want to disappoint. You can make ends meet, you <b>will</b> finish it. You have things to do, responsibilities, moral obligations. You cannot bear to let the spectators down, and so you grind your teeth, and move on. You focus on your task at hand, in case your emotions take over again and you make a false move that you end up regretting. Hyperstress, every moment you might burst, the pain dizzy and intoxicating - any reason to continue. You are a walking contradiction.</p>
<p>Scattered in the trash can lay the blue roses. Oh well, it should be 11:30 now. You should probably go find something else to do.</p>

<h2>01/01/25</h2>
<p>wwwwwww</p>
<p>You have your wall clock to keep you (reluctant) company. You have a few hours of solitude before the next person demands your complete attention. Where you are right now does not matter very much at this moment.</p>
<p>You are suddenly reminded of the day when you waited for your father to come back home from work, late at night. He said he wanted to talk to you about something. The day before, you had witnessed bitter fights between your parents - the kind of fight that required a moderator to intervene. You were wondering whether he would be scolding you for not exerting enough weight then. The anxiety was enough to tie your intestines into dozens of knots, but a little burst of bravery kept you waiting. Time seemed a too sluggish at that moment.</p>
<p>Which was what reminded present-day you of the memory in the first place.</p>
<p>Time is usually interpreted to be absolute. However, you tend to find Einstein's assertion a bit more correct to reality: "time is relative to one's frame of reference".</p>
<p>When you were little, you used to do something you would call "mind-time manipulation". When you would want time to slow down, you would instead channel impatient thoughts begging the clock to tick a little faster. Maybe you would also remind yourself of your boredom, and how desperately you wanted your school year to end - with some regulation, of course, to prevent you from sinking into negativity. The method would work miracles.</p>
<p>At this moment, you would want time to speed up, for the day to end already. End. End. End.</p>
<p>Yet, you wonder whether you can face your ending once it comes. Whether you are ready enough. Would you just spoil everything, similar to what you have been doing your entire miserable life? Probably. But as a subjective observer, you are not one to come up with definitive conclusions.</p>
<p>You wonder what you are fighting for now, when there is almost no purpose in continuing to drag on. You make excuses for yourself, as the coward that you are: you are doing it for your parents. So their investment would not go to waste. You cannot bear watching people grieve over your passing. Et cetera, until you are too scared to let the knife touch your wrist, your heart thumping in choruses of <i>no, no, no, no, no</i></p>
<p>No matter how much practice you have had with dealing with your own blood, you would not dare to end it all. How many billions of dong have been wasted on your education? And you sit here and wonder whether you should stop. Maybe the assertions of your lack of gratitude were not so wrong, after all.</p>
<p>Your school year starts in eight days, you wonder whether you will be able to catch up. The question was no longer "can I obtain passing grades for next year?", but rather "can I obtain enough opportunities for my future portfolio?". Any A+ or As or whatnot are simply tools for you to be the next teacher's pet, to obtain the next invitation for whatever event your tutors find fit. Conversations, talks, group projects are simply means to reach newer heights, gain a better reputation. You are well aware of how uneventful, how automatic your life has become. Exam, then exam, exam, exam, all put on repeat. Even the days themselves became repetitive - you wake up at dawn, walk the ludicrously long distance to the train station (while munching on breakfast), take the 45 minute train ride to school. Followed by classes at 8, breaks in the library or cafeteria, lunch, classes, then another journey back home. You are usually left with a pounding tiredness, the constant (unfulfillable) demands for a break. Maybe along the week you would have co curricular activities, i.e. you following instructions to a T without saying any unnecessary statements.</p>
<p>You find yourself losing interest in your hobbies, if you could call them that. Drawing? No, you have no ideas. Writing? No, you have no ideas either. Reading? You cannot, no amount of submersion into the next world could satisfy you these days. In fact, you have no idea what you want. You could only work. The next assignment, the next group project, they became your new routine. Before you knew it, you were absorbed into your studies, finding solutions and answering questions. They left you feeling drained, yes. But at least you were continuing on. Going along with the boredom and the silence. Deep down, you do not know what you were doing. What the point was.</p>
<p>You hear your parents talk. You thought your family was doing okay without you. For a while, you have been plagued by the belief that you were poisoning your own household. With you now gone for over months on end, your sibling seems to be growing up just fine. Your mother has already obtained what you can see (albeit with a blind eye) as a stable job. Your father was managing on with his usual routine, all the while teaching your sibling and continuing on with his hobbies of photo editing. A tech enthusiast, he was, and he would sometimes teach you about basic computer hardware and software. At times, he would show you some new cables, a fancy mouse, some new devices he bought over the Net, with excitement akin to a kindergartener, mind - the genuine excitement always managed to give some warmth to your chest. He seemed to be interested in generative AI, and although you are not in favour of such technology, he still managed to draw you in with his giddiness.</p>
<p>There were days where you were kicked out of your own home. You would walk aimlessly under the sodium yellow lights decorating the streets. Your walks usually lacked direction - left or right, it didn’t matter. Forward you strided, the sky still a tainted light blue. You would listen to music, click random buttons on your brick phone, anything to occupy yourself for the time being. The reason you were out was often quite simple: you stayed back at school too often, or you caused your sibling an accident, or you refused to listen to some of your parents’ instructions. Something like that.</p>
<p>Once, you heard your parents talking in the dead of night. You were not supposed to be there, obviously not. You were usually a heavy sleeper, but that day you were strangely awakened by an unknown force. You were standing by the thin wooden door leading to your parents’ lair, your heart pounding in your chest. The entire house was coated in black, with the only faint whisps of light coming from the room you were looking into.</p>
<p>Your parents were conversing in whispers. Divorce, you heard. Then “I want to keep the family together”. The next thing you heard was “you are too much a terrible father for my children”. Your father, at some point, was already raising his voice in anger, making your ears twitch slightly - your sibling was in bed, less than 50 centimetres away from where they were. You figured you were probably overstepping some boundaries, and you sneaked back to your mattress-bed. You tried to sleep, but to no avail. The presence of noise, although bare, did not help your case.</p>
<p>At some point, your curiosity took the better of you, and you found yourself clutching the thin wooden door again. You can no longer recall what they said at that specific moment, but you remembered sneaking back to bed before one of your parents stood up. In absolute fear, you raced back to bed and got the blanket on. Oh my fucking god.</p>
<p>Through your heavy eyelids, you could see all the lights being turned on in a feverish rage. Then they were off again. You heard noises from the kitchen, vague clunking from the bottom drawer where all the knives were. You heard footsteps You did not remember what happened next</p>
<br>
<p style="text-align:center;font-family:'Courier New'">Your mother still blamed you for not protecting her that day</p>
<br>
<p>Your family had always been somewhat unstable. Your parents had never once owned actual land property, leaving the family to the mercy of landlords. Not to mention, your school fees, tuition, clothes, nutrition, sustenance; along with that comes the question of your mother’s employment. There were months where your unemployed mother would be looming over you at home, the reason for such a situation never being any stranger: she was not satisfied with the offers she usually got. Meanwhile, your father had worked for the same company for over a decade, albeit with no promotion and a salary too low to maintain the family’s current socioeconomic status. What that entailed: your mother’s clothes and jewelry, your clothes and education, your family’s regularly maintained delicious meals and appliances. Attempts to emerge from the middle class. Non-jeopardized happiness.</p>
<p>Constantly struggling, unsatisfied, driven off the edge, <b>despair</b></p>

<p><sup>because it didn</sup>;<sup>t matter</sup></p>
<p>~~~</p>
<p>To be fair, you have always been confused about your very own identity. You felt like living in somebody else’s life, in a second person perspective. You live in a “she”, a “he”, narrating your actions in the third person, constructing up narratives for yourself. You can very well be manipulating yourself to the path of self-pity, and you would have absolutely no idea.</p>
<p>You have always lived under many names. “XXX”, “XXXX”, whatever the situation demanded of your persona. You could switch from giddy and excited to quiet and timid at the drop of a hat. You could be awkward and hilarious with your dry humour, and you could be respectful and composed, depending on the person speaking to you. It is not a skill, and certainly not one to be proud of, but you take pride in it nonetheless. As if others do not have the same skill as you do. As if you are unique.</p>
<br>
<p><b>Talent &#9647;</b></p>
<br>
<p>It has become harder and harder to justify your existence.</p>
<p>Sometimes, you find yourself back at the same spot, wondering whether there was any point in continuing on to the next step. With the hustle and bustle of life, you sweep the thought aside and pour your complete attention to whatever piece of work that is waiting at your desk at the moment. You continue with your packed schedule and everything else took second priority. However, when you are alone, you find yourself backtracking to where you left off.</p>
<p>When you were little, you were considered the odd one out. You were one of the little, childish members of the class who were self-centered and emotionally sensitive. Your name, your desk, whatever space you occupied always came along with a radioactive warning sign. You barely had any friends, and even if you did, your friendships did not tend to last long before breaking for one reason or another. Maybe you lied about something and your friends felt betrayed. Maybe you made them angry and did not know how to apologise. You always ended up on your own in the end. You once tried your best to initiate conversation, to make friends, but your insistent obsession with your own interests chased other children away. You were a particularly stubborn breed of human being.</p>
<p>At some point, you have come to the conclusion that you had not yet mastered the skill of pleasing others. You started to backtrack a bit. You spoke a little less, let others do their own thing, make their own choices. You chose to slow down, to walk behind so others would have the chance to lead. You were “making amends”, and you thought you would be more successful in making some new friends. You have always wanted friends. During your childhood, you have watched endless shows about the power of friendship, the importance of working together, and you have wanted that too. Being popular had always been a desirable thing, as the popular children had always got things going their way. Teachers looked in their direction and gave them opportunities. They had friends who love them and are willing to talk about whatever that interests them. They never had to worry about being alone.</p>
<p>You were living in your own bubble, creating your own worlds. The bathroom was your place of inspiration, the place where you would say everything out loud, let your brain do the painting and constructing. Characters became humans who interacted with other characters, with backstories, narratives, motives. You were never in those worlds - you had always been the spectator - but seeing your characters act out seemingly infinite amounts of colourful stories, that was enough to make you feel satisfied. One day, your character would be out at war. Another day, another one of your characters would be pregnant. And another day, one of your characters would be grieving the death of their family members. Maybe one of them found a new love. Another person probably got an invitation to one of the most prestigious schools in the city, and maybe they would be one step closer to stopping the ultimate villain from murdering their entire bloodline. You had got endless ideas in your arsenal, and enough time to execute them. You were building your world when your mother was carrying you around in her motorcycle, when you were showering, when you were home alone. You started to learn how to “extend” your limbs using your head, as you call it, using subtle head movements to signify dances, jumps, extension and withdrawal of appendages. You learnt how to lip-sync, you learnt how to converse in your own head, how to narrate. <i>"Stop it!" She finally mustered the courage to speak. "Arguing would do you all no good." "Who are you to say, when you are not contributing at all?" The other one next to her yelled back.</i> Finally, you could have some semblance of company, although you still had no words of dialogue. The songs you listened to became soundtracks for scenes, battle sequences, moments of grief, longing, love, shock, happiness, excitement. You were quiet in the company of real people, but when you were left to your own devices, you could speak to yourself for hours. People branded you as the weird child, but it barely mattered to you. You were finally able to move on with your life.</p>
<p>When you grew up a little more and reached puberty, the nature of your world started to change. You started to exert your own self, and the world itself also had more aspects of real life peppered into it. You were imagining what it would be like to act on your crush, to be admired and respected by all members of your class, to be popular and pretty. You were acting out scenes of people swooning over your image, satisfying your weak but big ego. A little self-indulgence would not hurt, you would say. After all, those ideal scenarios were also balanced out by imaginary situations where your parents would kick you out of the house for real, where you would decide to jump down from the highest floor of your school building, drown yourself in the nearby lake, where you would be abandoned by everyone, where you would cry your little tears out and beg and hopefully see a hero for your itsy bitsy teeny tiny little problems. Self-pity at its finest. Inflating your ego. And when life would come back and hit you with the real abandonment, with the real insults and the real pain, you would find yourself only able to squirm uncomfortably in your own shell, unable to coax the pain away. When your mother scolded you for being overweight, you could only cry and squeal, being unable to compose yourself with any suitable response. When nobody paid attention to your hard work and your prizes and awards, you could only look at the rightfully popular and talented children with jealousy. You wondered what your talent was, whether you were worth what you got. Then the truth hit you:</p>
<p>you were more ordinary than you thought</p>
<br>
<p>You eventually lost all idea of how to evaluate yourself. You could only eyeball it, rely on the opinions of others to gauge and adjust your conduct, because the mounds of feedback you were giving yourself were no longer perceived to be trustworthy. Were you exerting enough weight? Were you exerting too much? You cannot tell. People around you have a tendency to procrastinate, but if you step out of line and nag too much, they will probably hate you in the end … You do not want to be hated, you have known what that felt like for the longest time of your life. You have been bullied and you have bullied, and you would do everything in your power to prevent that from happening ever again. However, you could not see where to draw the line. Every part of your life seemed like a blur. Your teacher would encourage you to spill the beans, and yet, there was… <i>nothing to spill</i>. What is wrong with you? No clue. What were you worried about? You do not know. Maybe, you were hiding it from yourself, but at this point you decided not to trust any of your judgement. Your self-awareness murdered all of your self-trust, but perhaps it was for a good reason. You do not know. You do not know. You do not want to know. People told you to enforce self-discipline, draw your own boundaries, but you have no idea how - how not to be hated. No one taught you that.</p>
<p>Maybe, you could just carry on with being a shapeshifter, being a people-pleaser, morph with the changing times. You would probably be accused for lacking a spine, but what is the point of caring about such accusations? Your life has been worthless enough as it is, and dwelling on your <i>worthlessness</i> does not do anyone any favours.</p>
<p>Another year into the draining emptiness of work, it was. You went in, full dive, six feet underneath. Minutes on the computer writing a report became hours and hours. Not feeling hungry, you continued on typing every single black word, font size eight, on and on and on for pages and pages. Your eyes ached for a break, your brain ached for sleep. Your right eye hurt from a tension headache - or at least that was what Google told you. Your throat would constrict at times, each outburst for over 30 minutes or even an hour, just as how it would feel like to have one’s throat squeezed, out of breath. At times, you would stay up until 2 AM, writing about the economy or the social situation of whatever society you were researching on at the moment, although the bright lights around you would incorrectly suggest that it might still have been 8 PM. Writing, writing, writing … deleting paragraph after paragraph, rephrasing sentence after sentence, reformatting word after word, as your brain was as mushy as a pile of sludge. “Welcome to the witching hour,” your computer informed you. You would reluctantly go to bed, as you have school tomorrow. You set your alarm: 5:45 AM. You were only able to go on day by day because of your regular 10 minute naps at school - if it were not for them, your brain might very well have been boiled.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>It was a peaceful afternoon, after school. You and your friends were walking around, hanging out around the school grounds, which was remarkably clear of people and crowds. At times, the three of you would make your way to the nearby street, where some of your classmates stood eating street food: kimbap and chicken, the usual items. However, the peaceful atmosphere was not to be, as in an hour or so, the rest of the student body would be pouring out in droves, ants without a nest, swarming the streets.</p>
<p>“Do you think you can go back to take some ice cream?” Your friend continued to hold onto your arm, swinging it back and forth in an act of nagging.</p>
<p>“I can try …” You murmured reluctantly. They looked insistent, and you did not dare say no. However, deep inside, you feel a sense of discomfort squirming in the depths of your stomach. “Hopefully, with some luck.”</p>
<p>“Please, I’m hungry,” your friend insisted. Your other friend stared at both of you. The constant staring made you feel scrutinised.</p>
<p>“But my parents …”</p>
<p>“Can’t you tell them that you’re going out to take the trash?” The friend holding your hand continued their act of nagging. Biting your lip anxiously, you tried your best to stand your ground, but your friend’s puppy eyes stared right back at you, threatening to melt your heart. It was with no luck …</p>
<p>“OK, I’ll be back in a minute.” You sighed, the monster in your gut uncomfortably rising from its den. Your heart dropped into your intestines.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>It was with a few minutes later, that you were back again from your exploits.</p>
<p>“Sorry, I couldn’t take any ice cream, my parents were at the fridge,” you hurriedly apologised. “Although I think you could do with some seaweed.”</p>
<p>The one nagging earlier raised an eyebrow. “It’s really good,” you added quickly.</p>
<p>“... Uh, sure,” they looked unconvinced. Nonetheless, they took a leaf, and began munching. Your other friend followed suit. The three of you stood awkwardly in the middle of the street, eating packaged seaweed. The crowd of students had begun their way out, with all their hustle and bustle, and you could not feel any more awkward.</p>
<p>You stared around. Most of your classmates have left for their extra classes or for their homes. Although the crowd had started to thicken, the street your lot was standing on was largely deserted, with the occasional person passing by being mostly strangers. The quiet atmosphere only added to your silent anxiety as you held on to the oily packet of seaweed on your fingers - you were well aware of how strict your parents were. You took one leaf and began eating slowly to calm yourself down; however, your eyes were darting around repeatedly like a scanner.</p>
<p>After looking around for almost forever, you suddenly came across a particularly surprising find: <i>the person</i>, walking around with their friend, deep in conversation. As if excited by an electric shock, your heart quickened its pace as you almost audibly gasped - you were under the assumption that they had already left. You watched as they paced slowly, their head slightly bowed down deep in thought. Giddy from the happiness that you were wrong, you found your eyes automatically directed towards them, and their tall, slender figure - you could not help it. They were so beautiful, even from afar.</p>
<p>“Ah, it’s Y, huh? You were staring."</p>
<p>The accusation made your neck snap back into position, your ears now probably a shade of bright pink. Oh fuck.</p>
<p>“Uh …”</p>
<p>“Have you considered inviting Y to have some seaweed?” One of your nearby classmates suddenly chirped in. “You could do that.”</p>
<p>You stared back at them. “Wait, what?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, you can,” your friend, still munching on another seaweed leaf, chimed in.</p>
<p>“Uh …” The direction of conversation was too much to your disadvantage.</p>
<p>“Come on, get some courage,” your other friend, who was spectating the entire time the two of you exchanged back and forth about seaweed and ice cream, patted your shoulder lightly. “Come on.”</p>
<p>“You can do it.” The one who suggested the idea smiled at you expectantly.</p>
<p>“Wait what, no,” you shook your head vigorously.</p>
<p>“Come on!”</p>
<p>“Wait no-”</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>You found yourself, 5 meters away from the Ultimate Person, still clutching the box of seaweed like how one would clutch a lifeline. Your heart was pounding in your chest, your arteries threatening to burst. Oh my god. My god. My god. My god.</p>
<p>“Do it,” both of your friends snared at you and gave you a strong push.</p>
<p>My god.</p>
<p>“Uh, do you want some seaweed?”</p>
<p>Shit, here it comes.</p>
<p>They simply stared at you.</p>
<p>“Thanks, but you can eat it,” their friend politely answered for them.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p><b>Please accept the fact that you will never amount to anything</b></p>

<h2>09/02/25</h2>
<p>To be back again … at the swaddles of intimacy.</p>
<p>You felt the soft caress, the laughter, the messy rustles of hair … The Ultimate Person was right beside you. It was warm, orange and yellow danced around your figures … You could feel their sharp collarbone, and their small waist nestled comfortably in your arms, as they looked back at you, giggling. “It tickles,” their eyes seemed to smile at you.</p>
<p>You could not get over how warm, and sweet, and personal the moment was. It was just the two of you. You did not know how you got there, but the sweet touches of their breaths and their gorgeously lopsided smiles were enough to compensate for all the pains. They did not put on any perfume, and yet their smell marked itself on you, dizzy, intoxicating, fuzzy with a warmth akin to that of wine. Their soft, velvet skin brushed against your own. Their bare chest lay there, haphazardly covered by the blanket you two were under, only out of reach because they decided to turn their back on you. Like a little joke. Truly an effective way to get you to wish for more, to yearn in an almost animalistic desire, as your hands itched for soft skin. Whatever your heart craved for. The reward was tantalising, and so close, yet so far away, hung above your head, mocking.</p>
<p>And here you were again.</p>
<p>It was dark now. The time, space, location … did not matter. You presumed you were on a train, it certainly looked like so. You did not recall how you got here, either, but the other was underneath you, breathing heavily onto your bare chest. You could see them blushing intensely over the position of the two of you, and your situation. Ah. How did you get here?</p>
<p>“You insist …?” The woman whispered, flinching a little as your hair brushed against her neck. Ignoring her silent whimpers, you bent down and began taking off her undershirt, her deflated breasts cradled in your rough, slightly bloodied fingers.</p>
<p>You decided not to reply. Your head still bowed low, you slithered down, one finger caressing her figure, stopping at her large, bloated, white belly with the remnants of stretch marks and imprints of tight waistbands. Her clothing had left numerous dark marks, similar to bruises, a subtle reminder to her of how … undesirable she had become. Your tough finger on cool flesh, you could feel her shiver, and the goosebumps. The weather was not too cold, and no wind had passed your vicinity … she was probably scared. Like she should be.</p>
<p>Your finger circled her belly. You made a point to delay a little bit, although you could feel her body whimpering, and her legs subconsciously shifting and moving apart. With how close your face was to her undergarments, you could sense her getting humid over the touch. You poked the watery belly a few times, a little gift left behind from her birth of your brother several years back. You could make out the scar from the C-section in the dim light of night. Ah.</p>
<p>She decided it was time to moan. The old, cowardly noise echoed the damp air, purple and ultraviolet, ultramarine blue, lapis lazuli. In the vicinity, she was the damp, cold piece of raw, white meat. Inedible. You could see the stars if you creaked your head upwards a little.</p>
<p>Your finger ghosted over the black lace. You could already feel the heat, and another moan from above begged you to unwrap her quickly. Hahah… how impatient. She would have to wait.</p>
<p>You have seen this piece of undergarment before, when you were folding her clothes and helping your other parent do the laundry.</p>
<p>After you examined the lace for another few seconds, your finger made contact with the rough hair, and your nail scratched her smooth, red skin as you slowly pried the piece of cloth off her hips. She shifted a little, her leg sliding apart a little more, another light moan escaping her lips. Your hands now sliding under her torso, two naughty snakes, you leaned forward, letting your hips crash against her own. As your nipples made contact with hers, you moved yourself back and forth, as your eyes dazedly pinned onto the older woman, her flushed red face and plump wet lips.</p>
<p>“Mpmph …” The noise escaped her throat as your mouth clawed over hers, your tongue exploring the vicinity of her teeth a little too harshly. Your hands have now made their way to her head and neck, and you could feel her sweat, damp on your fingers, stinging the flesh wounds on your cuticles. “Ah.”</p>
<p>You let go of one hand and, with considerable effort, slowly hoisted her up a little bit. The other hand, having found its way to her shifting torso, traced her humid anal region mindlessly. In the heat of the embrace, her warmth enveloped you and ate you alive. Meat in the microwave. The smell of sweat circled the air similar to a kettle of hungry vultures. You let the sheer desire and lust consume you, as you released her lips, now numb and swollen from the heated kiss. You crashed into her again, another moan escaping her throat. Your throat was too dry to make any noise, and your head was too hot to make any informed decisions. Her neck seemed tasty meat, and you found yourself biting deep onto the dry skin, flaky and cold. Your teeth dug as far as you could, until you tasted, in numb surprise, metal red. When your animalistic brain finally decided to let go and attend to her needs, you could already see the precum leak, almost desperately.</p>

<br><br><p>Would it be nice to ask for something raw, and real, and intimate? <s>To know that all was just a dream.</s></p>
<p>To know that things would just be the same, over and over again … You are tired of <s>torturing</s> helping yourself for so long. A bit of company would help. Not as if you do not have any, but your feelings never seem to come across properly to them. You are tired of constantly sending signals repeatedly. You desperately wished to let them enter your personal life, but some part of you wanted to conserve dignity, the sense of ownership, that you have a life to own. That you have control. It is sad, honestly.</p>
<p>There you were again, rat face. Staring at the Ultimate Person. You had to leave today. It needed to happen. Ah, to let go. To let go. Of all the happiness, the warmth and the yellow, mellow walks down an unknown street, love overflowing so deep,</p>
<p style="text-align:left">You release your leash <span style="margin-left:588px">and they leave to the other side</span></p>

<p>Ever since you went here, you have been hiding from something.</p>
<p>Sometimes you wonder whether the Ultimate Person was haunting you. Their presence when you went … Your final days with them and everyone else was nothing less than a living nightmare. To watch as everybody around you <i>earn</i> a <i>significant other</i> was not a nice reminder. You were attached to somebody, surprisingly enough, but the terms and condition of the relationship was controversially written. As far as you can remember, the relationship was heavily one-sided.</p>
<p>Yet, the soft kiss at the cinema still left your face red and confused. The little dates you had with them, walking around school, holding hands, conversing in a cafe, singing each other goodbyes. You even folded them a paper heart once, and you hugged them publicly in class. You definitely blushed more than once, you once dashed to the bathroom just to calm down and check how red your face was. You looked forward to talking to them, messaging them, you remembered yourself anxiously checking your phone for a reply. Every single conversation was akin to a therapy session between 2 emotionally damaged people, and they had healed you as much as they could. The person said they wanted to die. The school’s top-most floor was open for access, the balcony facing the sky. They said they wanted to jump. You could only beg them to stop, to cling onto something, albeit uselessly. Your prior experience with those thoughts did not help you. You told them to continue because there are others who love them. Of course, in a spiteful twist, they did not agree with you one single bit. You still came back to see them in one piece, luckily enough, but your relationship was messier than it ever could have been. They managed to enter your dreams. You craved for the compliments and the care that they had given you, the reminders to go to shower early, the scoldings when you said you slept late the night before. You could only return with a listening ear, just as you promised in your resume. You felt guilty for wanting, but was it their fault for giving you access to such luxuries, after all? It felt nice to be pampered.</p>
<p>Your friends informed you of their mental state on the other side. They said they missed you. It was that way for months. You did not know what to say. “At this point, __ should have forgotten me already.” Of course. Not you disregarding their feelings. You make for a terrible therapist.</p>
<p>You went to the other side, you believed you could start again from square one. Move on from all the drama that littered your life. Live happily with self respect, love, compassion, all the works. Maybe even make some more friends. Gain a better reputation. Perhaps, you can even be some sort of teacher’s pet if you try hard enough. Everything was new, you were exposed to a friendlier, more supportive environment, full of people who respect you. The people close to you say they <i>love</i> you. It was difficult, trying to remind yourself who you used to be. It felt similar to losing part of your own identity. For the longest time, loneliness had defined you. Now, even that has been lost. But nonetheless, you had to continue on.</p>
<p>But not for the Ultimate Person, of course, who decided to stick with you for more than you’ve bargained for.</p>
<p><i>Every single person who looked similar to them became a blunt imitation of them.</i></p>
<p>How sweet, no?</p>
<p><i>I don;t want to look at A#3428*</i><br>They reminded you of the Ultimate Person, with all their academic <b>talent</b> and competence. They even look similar to them. They were so nice to you this year, you were confused on how to approach them. They put in the <i>effort</i> to go <i>talk</i> to you.</p>
<p><i>I dont’ want to talk</i><br>You are scared of facing the truth, are you? That your heart had betrayed you, and more than once. Clinging onto a “love” for the Ultimate Person would not do anyone any favours.</p>
<p><i>I don;t want to talk get outI don/t want to talk</i><br>You coward, you could not even dare to look into A#3428*'s eyes. You cannot face even that ending you craved for so much. The end? More like the escape.</p>
<p><i>I don.t want to talk</i><br>Face it. They, and everybody else, will never provide you with the intimacy that you oh so wanted.</p>
<p><i>I don.,t want to face it</i><br>Face it.</p>

<p>Ah.</p>
<p>People say they love you. They write you Valentine’s notes, they give you presents. The day before, you could see them hoard a Santa Claus’ bag worth of presents for their friends and loved ones. They said they had a surprise for you too. “What is it?” You asked yourself. They said you would not have to worry about it not being functional. Now that piqued your interest. You were surprised that people would even bother giving you presents for Lovers’ Day. You have learnt to accept the fact that you were single, and alone, after all. They even told you that you could tell them anything, and they would do anything for you. They say they love you from the moon and back. They say they’d steal the moon for you if you’ve asked. They say they understand, and they tell you to live for yourself and your loved ones, a life free of burdens or suffering. Of course. If “only”s and “but”s were candy and nuts, we would all have a Merry Christmas!</p>
<p>Being in the state that you are in, it would be difficult for you to genuinely enjoy yourself. To feel less bored, would you not want to spike life with some suffering? Sadness sticks more strongly to people than joy.<br>Deep down, you know that you intentionally sleep late so your sleep would actually feel refreshing.<br>You know that you starve yourself so that your meals would actually be tasty and not triggers for vomiting.<br>You know that you grind yourself in work for hours so that breaks would actually feel rewarding.<br>You know that you curse yourself so that the compliments people give you would actually mean something.<br>You know that you tell yourself you are useless so that you would actually have the motivation to go find <b>meaning</b>.</p>
<p>“Fake it ‘till you make it” Smile until you are actually happy.</p>

<br>
<p>What is happiness? What is being happy? Is it the mellow walks around school, under the yellow sunlight, doing small talk with your friends? Or is it the silent trips to the bookstore on quiet weekend afternoons on your bike? The rash crossings of motorways on your bike that always leave you laughing? The glances from the Ultimate Person that made you giggle excessively? The fact that your friends were there to hear you rant about how talented and beautiful they were every single time? The times when your Dad would call you over to give you a taste of his delicious roasted pork fresh from the pan? When you and your Dad would fix your bike or some random electronics together? Or is it when your mother does not call you fat or ugly? When you face a quiet home after school? When you do not have to deal with suppressed anger or arguments? When you wandered for hours out in the streets, bathing in the sodium yellow lights, not having to go home because you have nowhere to go to? Cowering under a parked car on the sidewalk, barefoot, with no money or phone to communicate or to survive, barely having the strength to even take a nap or cry? Hiding in the bathroom, kicking and screaming, not having to hear your mother’s mocking words when she told you you were too overweight to dress pretty? Or is it when people no longer laugh at you because you wore your red scarf differently, when people do not ignore you and your dozens of waves and smiles? Is it when you have successfully called an ambulance for your mother and the endangered foetus in her belly? When you no longer have to see a pool of blood staining the bathroom floor and toilet, your mother’s cowering body and her bloodied mustard yellow dress? When your Dad is no longer holding the kitchen knife threateningly to your mother’s chest, the darkness no longer enveloping the two of them in a blank embrace? When the police had left your home and all was well? No screams, no yells? When your mother no longer had scratches on her arms, and your Dad no longer had scars on his face? Is it when your mother was not so angry to the point where she took the broom and you had to defend yourself? When your Dad was not complaining about your mother stealing his money? When you no longer had to send messages to your pregnant mother, begging her to unblock your Dad’s number? When people no longer disregard your situation and treat your family like a soap opera with a load bunch of supervillains? Is it wrong to not know what being “happy” means? Is it wrong to hold pride to living such a life?</p>

<p>Does it even matter?</p>
<br><br><h1 id="803321403">Dangerously Unstable ChemicalGirl:RadicalElectron</h1>
<h2>22/02/25</h2>
<p>You were in the library when it happened.</p>
<p>Actually, nothing happened. You could verify that nothing happened. Sure, you were a little stressed with how your ideas kept getting rejected, but in the end it should be fine. At least, you tried to convince yourself that it would be fine. Really, what could you do other than pretend that everything is fine? What is “fine”, anyway?</p>
<p>As long as you <i>look</i> fine, all should be fine, right?</p>
<p>*</p>
<div style="background-image:url(apple.png);float:right;background-size:112.2%;background-repeat:no-repeat">
<p>The last few days had been a ridiculous frenzy of events. This happened to you, that happened to you, then you had to attend to this, to that, to whatever event that came across your calendar, et cetera. You were confused, you were tired, the usual, bootstrap narrative. That is at least what you told yourself. Your eyes were heavy with the lack of sleep that you got, but with all the coffee in the world, you would eventually manage to continue on anyway. Your bag was heavy, and skies were dark, and it was hard to speak without stumbling and fumbling on some text, but you managed to pull yourself together, like you have always done. You put on the happy, cheerful face, and life goes on, in a sad, repetitive circle, of nothingness. You feel nothing, just as you expected of yourself. Everything could not have been written any more perfectly.</p>
<p lang="ja" xml:lang="ja" style="user-select:none"><s>苦しくて　悲しくて　悔しくて　やめたくて それすらも　許されず　なにもかも　失うだけで</s></p>
<p>Of course, dragging on as such came with some negative side effects. After all, life is not just smiles and rainbows, although it would have been nice if it was. You just had to deal with a little stress, a little anxiety, like everyone else. Exam stress plus additional trigger from the one Ambiguous Person could easily leave you jittery and acting inappropriately for days from the all the invisible worries. You use unusually high volumes when you were supposed to converse with people. You forget things. You say socially inappropriate statements and get criticised for it. You express emotions inappropriately in public and got a couple dozen eyes locked on you. You lose sense of your responsibilities, your tact, your composure. Pretty soon, it did not take long for you to lose yourself too. Why are you here? What are you doing? All questions that you <b>used to</b> have an answer for, but no more. You feel like others are looking at you similar to how they would treat a bratty, eleven-year-old child. It did not matter how much progress you made trying to control yourself. It did not matter how much you did trying not to let your ego get to you. You would always revert back to <i>exit 0</i>, square one, a miserable, empty cycle of despair.</p>
<p lang="ja" xml:lang="ja" style="user-select:none">ただ意味も理解せずに歌うパラジクロロベンゼン<br>その先にたどり着いて何もないと知ったけど<br>何の為に生きるのか　ボクは野良猫に話しかけた<br>ボクの生きる価値は何？　野良猫は水に溺れ死んだ<br>今のボクは何をしてる？　それすらわからない</p>
<p>You used to have no friends because of the exact, same reason. People who believe they know you say that such people do not deserve you, yet when your mind managed to surface above all the panic, the only thing it was telling you was that history would repeat itself. You <b>would</b> lose all you have one day, it is a fact of life. It is precisely how the system should be going. You should be adjusting to it, especially since you have known loneliness so well. Of course, being a loner comes with disadvantages. You felt left out in absolutely everything. You stick out from the class body like a sore thumb. When you were little, you studied with people older than you, all of whom rightfully treated you as a primary school child, because the truth is, you were a primary school child. You were known to be clingy, and you cried a lot. Crying is fine, until you cry because of every single itsy bitsy tiny little detail in your life. You cry because people teased you for liking a show, or for being so insistent about things that you went out of your way to physically force it onto people. You <i>want</i> friends, you really wanted some, but in the same breath, you do not want to get too attached. What if they hate you once they know something about you? <s>What if they found new and better friends?</s> As much as you, being as rational as you are, would like to deny it, you are a boring person. You have nothing going for you, lest for your academics. And you did not perform significantly better at any subject either. No matter how hard you tried, you were unnoticed for years. People did not see you as a credible figure to ask science-related questions to, or something of the sort. People did not see you as a person who is good at math. The only thing they see you as is a person who gets good results, nothing more and nothing less. In a student-oriented society where grades do not define people, you cannot stand out from the crowd. You were always at the back of the class, you were always getting the short end of the stick in one way or another. You were the last person to be chosen, you were never called up, as if the entire teacher body were in some cruel joke against you. It felt that way. The receiving end of a personal vendetta, a name in a blacklist. You tried your best to be nice, to be respectful, to hand in work on time, to be responsible, the usual ways to be a decent person, but nobody took notice. Not that they needed to, but if that were the case you would be a bit happier. “You did well”, you yearn to hear that statement come genuinely from someone, someone who was solely looking at how you showed your abilities and not who you were outside of whatever it was you were doing. Compliments coming from your family and friends started to lose their meaning. <i>They could just be looking at me as a friend or a family member, or they could be biassed with how much they</i> love <i>me</i>. <s>What a selfish and narcissistic assumption.</s> But that was the only thing you could ever dream of receiving. Even if you got a compliment, you tend to disappoint people later down the line. You were a bad friend, a bad team player, you did not know how to lower yourself enough for people to disclose their opinions, you tend to get into arguments about the creative direction of things. At this point, you were dead sure that people hated your guts over your incessant nagging about deadlines and the like. Your friends also surely took a step back after the amount of confusing negative signals they got from your emotional attachment issues. Of course you were trying, but it takes time to learn how to tone your emotions down, present yourself better, wear a better mask with better presentation.</p>
<p>You wish you could live an average life.</p>
<p>You wish you did not have to fight for good grades as if your future career entirely depended on it.</p>
<p>People tend to brush off your concerns, but you were so sure that there were not many career options for a person such as you. Being the unsocial human being that you are, you decided not to meddle in business, marketing, negotiation, or any job that had “regular human interaction” under its list of important priorities. However, to be fair, you have never had many choices. The last thing your parents wanted was for you to be deported back to where you came from and working under endorsement of corruption. At the same breath, they could not afford for you to go any further than where you are now. You were insanely lucky to earn such an opportunity that costed so little economically, and there was obviously no guarantee that you would be able to obtain another of similar nature. People consider countries in Europe and America, Australia, other first-world countries as viable, attractive options, but your family could not stretch itself that far to support you financially on such exploits. A billion dong, the bare requirement regarding parental bank accounts for people your age to even be allowed to study in the US, was too much a far-fetched dream. Your family, throughout its 16 years of existence, could not even afford an <i>apartment room</i>, much less savings in the billions, which would be <i>only enough</i> to afford a small house in the capital city. Not to mention, your family have been under risk of fallout for over a decade. Even now, you could still remember when you were six, having to sit outside in the scorching hot, no-air-con stairway, waiting for your parents to finish arguing inside your family’s only rented room. In the same room, you also remembered plates being thrown, your mother crying, your father yelling and screaming, and later on you also had both of your grandparents talking to you privately, convincing you to try and calm your parents down as a last-ditch effort to save the abomination that was your family. There were many times when “divorce” was on the table for consideration. There were many times where custody of yourself was in the equation. Now, with your sibling, the issue was further compounded by orders of magnitude. But one thing remained the same. <b>You</b> were <b>not</b> their main priority.</p>
<p>You never were. In fact, you were the first in a series of poorly executed decisions and mistakes. You are, literally, a mistake. An error made in a particularly heated night. Your sibling was also under the same umbrella. New life in this family, in this corporate cog machine of living, were all mistakes. Never meant to happen. None of them were ready to suffer.</p>
<p>You never talked about any of your thoughts, as you were sure that people would dismiss them. As complaints, as blowing things way out of proportion, something along the lines. “What does your parents’ income have to do with your choices?” They ask. People whose families are emotionally and financially stable ask. People who had happy childhoods ask. People who do not suffer from the same experiences ask, toothless and apathetic.</p>
<p>It was the same cycle of despair, over and over again.</p>
<p>You wondered, how people in the past viewed you. The Ultimate Person, how did they view you? Probably an emotionally fraught, radical child. You have had the list of insults memorised by now. As much as you have known, there was always an invisible barrier between you and society, that you, as an outcast, had to pass. As time has shown, you were never able to truly break the endless cycle of loneliness. You wondered whether there was any point to changing such a predicament. It felt like to a natural phenomenon at this point, akin to water’s boiling point being 100<sup>o</sup>C, akin to like charges repel and unlike charges attract. Nothing was going to change.</p>
<p>You wish you were pretty.</p>
<p>People close to you tend to sugarcoat things, as they knew what you had <i>been through</i>. <s>What ridiculous ways to approach such a fact. Pity was never welcomed.</s> They said you are pretty, that people outside were “missing out”, or something similar. To be fair, you could see what they mean sometimes. <s>Narcissistic much?</s> You looked at the mirror, and you saw a jaded, but decently pretty human being staring back at you with a lopsided smile. Really, you could have just gone with that view, if not for the numerous times you were told you were overweight. Fat, rotund. Whatever adjectives people use these days, they all mean “horizontally challenged”. You look in the mirror again, and you see a face as round as a porcelain dish, with massive reservoirs of what seems to be fat clogging up your cheeks, a face of a child attached to a rapidly developing body. Not to mention your dark circles, which made you look similar to prisoners at times, especially when you decided to put on a neutral face. Sometimes, you found yourself smiling excessively for hours on end just to look presentable. People like cheerful, happy girls. Emo girls are only acceptable if they look thin, defined and pretty. People who are chubbier are generally perceived as “fine”, that is if they look cute or pretty enough. That was what society expected of girls. Of you. Your mother wants you to grow taller to be more attractive, closer to the average beauty standard. Lose weight, do more exercise, obtain a sharper, longer face with less chubby cheeks. Delete the black circles, remove the glasses, wear skirts and dresses. You were the rag doll that she wished to transform into porcelain. She herself had modified lips. She regularly defined her eyebrows, did makeup, wore cute short skirts and classy suits. She said she looked fat and overweight, and nobody had managed to convince her otherwise for years. You personally have given up on her. Perhaps that was where all of her comments originated from.</p>
<p>Why were other people born pretty, you ask.<br>Why did others get to have <i>happy families</i> whose members <i>love each other</i> and <i>bond over things</i>?<br>Why did others get to be in financially stable conditions where they can <i>do whatever they want and still be able to stand up in this economy?</i><br>Why could you not be like them? Have a normal life?</p>
<p><b>What did you DO WRONG?</b></p>

<p>To remember that you wanted to be like the Ultimate Person, with support from the class, with support from teachers and family. To dismiss their achievements and solely attribute them to being unusually lucky. To wish they were you.</p>
<p>To wish you had money. <s>Dreams of the middle class</s><br>To wish you had happiness. <s>Hope creeping in the despair</s><br>To wish you had company. <s>A radical electron needs a pair</s><br><s>To wish you have yourself back</s></p>

<h2>09/03/25</h2>
<p><i>She</i> loves falling. <br>To drop without a reason to the bottom of the pit, then she touched her face bemusedly - a wet sensation - and saw red tainting her young fingers. She almost had to go for a stitch for her torn lip, but in the end, she left the injury as it was. Now, the scar was barely there.</p>
<p>Do you love falling, too?</p>
<p>The old narrative was getting rather boring. “I barely slept” “I have a headache” “My eye hurts” “Nobody understands me” “Nobody cares” “I’ll find reassurance alone in this despair”, repetitive, manufactured. Empty and soulless. With stories of other people plugged hastily into your ears, you concocted sob stories for your miserably uneventful life, reiterations, as if you were a broken record. Cowardly as you are, you yearned for some sympathy and love from your friends and teachers. Did you enjoy it when they babied you? Did you enjoy it when people gave you a modicum of their attention, fully directed, precisely only for you? Did you enjoy it?</p>
<p><i>Pathetic.</i></p>
<p>Sometimes, you crave for a feinting spell to hit. You pray to the higher figure up There, for a collapse down the stairs, on the train ride, in PE class - wherever, the location is not of particular interest to you. With your friends, you moan and whine about the tiniest details, with an “ugh”, an “oh my goodness, Jesus Christ”, about … how much homework you have. How much tasks you have on your fingers. Considering how you brought it onto yourself, even a part of you could recognise the ridiculousness of all of it.</p>
<p>That one day you stuttered 15 times, on your walk back home, the story resurfaced back again. One foot over the other, you thought: “Am I carrying things too far?” Your eyes darted to the calm ripples of the river, and the otters beneath the water. The midday sun looked at you, almost condescendingly with its brightness, enveloping the sky awkwardly in an almost grey blue colour. Squinting, you looked back down to the road, to see your skirt hanging loose on your hips. You readjusted the piece of fabric, dragged down by the weight of your phone and keys in its pockets. “Am I overthinking things too much? Or should I be more careful?” You forcefully looked ahead, slightly squinting to fight the Sun’s beaming rays of light. Fumbling with the pocket fabric, you gingerly withdrew your phone to change to a new song. “Am I laughing too much? Am I being annoying? Am I being too unhinged?” “Am I overthinking things again? Is this OK?”<br>
Breathlessly laughing a bit to yourself, you continued on your journey back. “I’m sure I saw … I’m sure I felt <i>their</i> annoyance, really.” You were talking to no one in particular, but in spirit, <i>she</i> is with you and listening to your every word. Almost automatically, as though on cue, she pensively responded, “Do you think you should tone yourself down a bit?”<br>
Left in deep thought, you slowed down your walking as your brain slowly tumbled into a halt. “What do you mean, <i>tone myself down a bit</i>? Is that even possible?” You conjured up a self-portrait with a skeptically raised eyebrow.<br>
“You can consider … you can consider acting a little more mature than what you’re doing right now.” She seemed to look past you into some faraway distance.<br>
“It’s their fault.” You mumbled to yourself, barely audible. “It’s <i>their</i> fault that I feel so safe being so expressive.” “Then stop,” she did not let you finish your sentence. “Stop associating with them.” You found yourself stopping at a crossroads. “Don’t let other people influence you and your <i>image</i>. Don’t let others jeopardise your reputation.” Seeing as the coast was clear, you ran for it. Your heart racing, you broke into a run as her words echoed in the back of your head. “<b><i>Stop smiling if you have to</i></b>.”</p>
<p>”I know I have depression,” you looked at her in frustration. “I <i>know</i>, don’t underestimate me.”<br>
“Then why,” she looked straight into your darkened, restless eyes, “can’t you help yourself?” Under the dim white lights of your room, she seemed to be barely resemble a shadow, standing menacingly next to you, one hand on her hip. Relaxed to a chair in a room with no one, you played a little with your box cutter before you looked back at her.<br>
“I can,” you looked at her with exasperated eyes. “It’s just that I …”<br>
“Stop with the justifications,” her strong stare nailed you to an invisible wall. Her shadow consumed the room, a wave of energy, the elephant in the room - eating up the quiet and the peace. Half amusedly in response: “What am I supposed to say? That is the truth.” You cannot seem to meet her eyes. “Without all of this, I won’t be able to go on.” Your eyes diverted to the window. The sky had been dark for over an hour, a black velvet coating the sky, showered with tiny bright dots resembling stars. At the bright city life in front of you, you could only sigh.<br>
“Stop victimising yourself.” Her words bluntly slapped your ears. “Stop pretending you are weak, stop asking for the help you know you don’t need. You know you can stand up on your own. You have to.”<br>
Your lips tight, you glued your eyes to the bustling life outside - or rather, what remained of it. As the numerous dots of light moved on and about, you saw the road, empty and unoccupied, with single stalks of white light illuminating the peacefulness below. The trees stood static, there, their leaves unwavering, stubborn.<br>
“What’s so wrong with wanting?” You finally turned back to face her.<br>
“Greedy as you are,” she looked away from you, a hint of disapproval in her voice. “You know this would not work, and it will never work.” She walked to the door, staring straight into your eyes before she turned the doorknob. “Stop hoping.”<br>
“Isn’t this what everyone wanted?” You raised your voice, for no particular reason. Your hands slowly curled into fists as you moved your chair with an ear-splitting <i>slid</i> and stood up. “For me to heal myself? For me to call for help and get what I need?” You took a stride, one, two, three, until you finally found yourself facing her, her blank face staring back at you with the same vigour it held earlier.<br>
“Contradictory,” she leaned closer to your face, her pupils unmoving, her voice soft akin to a breeze. She suddenly smiled. “You are not helping yourself.” With her audacity, she slowly walked away, one foot after the other, soft and angelic steps.<br>
“Can’t I hold onto something?” You found yourself screaming. With all the rage boiling in you, you ran after her figure. “Can’t I keep some identity to myself? Do I honestly have to lose every part of myself? Can’t you -” you grabbed her by the shoulder - “can’t you just,” you huffed another breath, “accept this as a part of me?” You pinned her to place. “This is me.” You pulled her face closer to your own. “You see me? This is me. This is my despair. Wouldn’t you want,” you found yourself slowing down, a senseless pit forming in your gut, “wouldn’t you want …” you felt something pushing out, your jaw firmly stuck in place. It took everything in you to keep it moving. “To help me a little? To <b>save</b> -” your voice wavered in how much strength it took to keep going - “me …?”<br>
She let out a breathy laugh, a beautiful one, albeit mocking. “I wouldn’t want to help someone who couldn’t even help themself,” she weakly smiled. “It is shameful, how much attention you crave …” She leaned back a little. “As if you were begging people to look at you.” She laughed again. “How hard was it to stop smiling, really?” Her face contorted into something of mock curiosity. Disgust. “How hard was it to deny how everyone loves you now? How <i>hard</i> was it,” her finger found your chin, “living in denial like this?”<br>
“But …” you found it harder to speak. “Didn’t you say I should hold myself back …? Isn’t this what I am … supposed to … do?”<br>
“You hold yourself back to keep your image,” she stared straight through you, her pupils shrinking to that of a cat. “Not to construct a sob story of how hurt you are. Stop playing this game, as if you are so <i>clever</i> -” she gritted her teeth for the first time - “and <i>calculated</i>,” she took a little step towards you, so close that you could see the gleam in her eyes, “as if you know <i>everything</i>,” you felt a hard slap hit your cheekbone. Your entire body vibrated, your brain disoriented, and you could only look at her, her stone cold face of disgust, as she stared you down, pinned you to the ground, six feet underneath. “You narcissist.”</p>
<p>”<b>Why didn’t you do anything?</b>” Your mother’s hushed voice echoed in the darkness. In the pit, six feet underground, you could make out the shadows of your father, with the rusty, but sharp, kitchen knife in his hands, and your mother, who just sat up, her disoriented breathing striking heavy chords in the silence.<br>
“Trust me, I wouldn’t kill her,” your father gritted his teeth, his arms half-heartedly moving upwards in surrender. “Trust me,” he hurriedly continued, “I wouldn’t find the heart to actually kill her,” he looked at the knife, before putting it down, “Really, I mean it when I say I couldn’t find the heart to end this with her.”<br>
“It’s harder to kill than you’d think,” you thought. You were reminded of the days where you could only dream, of enough grit, to stab yourself or drown yourself in the nearby lake, to <i>commit</i>. It was hard to commit. It was hard to find enough justification for it.<br>
“You know how close that thing was,” your mother tried to control her heavy breathing. “Why didn’t you even try to stop him?”<br>
“I trusted him,” but you could not find the heart to say the sentence aloud. You stood there blankly, your eyes distancing themselves in dissociation, your soul seemed to leave your body. “It’s hard to commit to killing, I know that.” You could not speak. How would you explain yourself?<br>
“<b>Why didn’t you do anything?</b>” Your mother’s voice pierced you again. Panic enveloped your figure as you could not find the will to open your mouth. Your body was stuck in place.<br>
“<b>Tell me.</b>” Your mother raised her voice.<br>
“...” You physically forced your mouth open. “I know it’s hard to kill.” You cannot say. “I trust him,” you decided to say. “I know he wouldn’t stab you.” You managed to muster.<br>
“Say that again,” your mother’s voice was hushed. You could hear a sharp inhale coming from your infant sibling, sleeping peacefully. Both of your parents’ eyes seemed to pierce you, stab you into muteness. As much as you wish to disappear, you could not get out of this just yet.<br>
“I don’t think he will.” You chose to say.<br>
“What if he did?” Your mother raised her voice a little. Your sibling stirred in their sleep, and your anxiety stirred from its slumber. “What if he did?”<br>
“ … I don’t know,” you mumbled. “I know he wouldn’t.”<br>
“Why do you trust him so much?” Your mother’s stare pierced your gut. The uncomfortable monster sleeping inside reared its ugly head, and you could only feel the monstrous emptiness pulling you down six feet underground. “Why do you trust a potential killer so much?” Her voice screams provocative.<br>
“Do not say that of me,” your father seemed to say. You could not register your surroundings anymore, only the darkness, the darkness, the darkness. “You can leave,” he turned to you, and the silence enveloping the lifelessness of the room. “Go to bed.”<br>
“Don’t you leave me here,” your mother interjected, “don’t you leave me here with a murderer. Don’t you leave me here.”<br>
You could only stand there like an NPC character.<br>
“Don’t worry, I won’t,” your father attempted to reassure you. “Don’t worry about her, go to bed, it’s OK.”<br>
“What a disgrace,” you heard your mother say. “How ungrateful do you have to be, to - to -”<br><br>

<h2>18/04/25</h2>
<p>Ultimate Plans. Endgame. Who doesn’t have that? You know, the <i>Ultimate Goals</i> in life. What do you want, what do you strive for, that type of thing.</p>
<p>About a week ago, you were searching for something, right? You opened your old logs, your Cloud accounts, and you were scrolling back for a link. What was it again? Hm … Pictures, photos, files … Ah, there it is. It is apparently called <b>satanservice.org/coe/ </b>, it has been a while since you’ve last ventured there. Of course. What is this?</p>
<p>You promptly clicked on the link. The text was tiny, it should be font size 11 or 10 for how small it is. You scrolled down a little.</p>
<p>You’ve decided against asphyxiation, you know you would never be able to commit to it. That is for sure. You would not even dare to step off the chair and let your feet hang. You do not want pain – who wants pain anyway? (Except for masochists, of course.) And obviously drowning is off the charts, you could swim, and it was difficult to try to submerge yourself deep in water for long enough for that to work. You tend to float, and after a while you would guess that your human instincts would kick in to carry you out of water. You never really committed to trying, but you have had an impression of it. It was not so good.</p>
<p>You thought poison would be a bit nicer, a little more kind. You scrolled down a little. Way before this, you have thought of cyanide. You can find that in apple seeds, rather easy to access. You would not have to buy it from any chemical store, lest people sit and ask you questions. (More like you were concerned for your wallet.) After skimming through what can be pages of justifications, the usual arguments, rebuttals and contemplative thinking, you see what you need. Ah. You’d probably have to resort to the lab, the seeds only contain amygdalin. When the seed is crushed under moist conditions, hydrogen cyanide gas can be released (effective defense against insects), but most attempts by adults tend to be non-lethal, with long-lasting side effects. Gram-size bites of laetrile with some hydrolysing enzymes could work, for instance crushed almonds with laetrile pills, but there are not many places that really manufacture the drug anymore. Plus, the seeds would have to be thoroughly crushed in moist conditions and ingested immediately. Not very ideal.</p>
<p>You scrolled down a bit more, some of your curiosity peeking out now. Huh. People could buy the pure salt as long as they sign some legal papers and have some money … You could search Google right now, actually. “sodium cyanide” There it is. You sense a little relief. Oh, you can actually buy it? That would be nice.</p>
<p>You plan to contemplate more options. You went back to the website and scrolled down.</p>
<p>Depressants are out of the picture. Unless you drag yourself to the psychiatrist, of course, you have all the main symptoms and everything. Nonetheless, you did not think about it much, and you decided to continue on.</p>
<p>Apparently non-lethal injections of potassium chloride salt can sting really badly.</p>
<p>You can try alcohol via enema (injected into the rectum), 3-6 times more lethal than via mouth. You cannot vomit the alcohol out and the process would be quicker than you think. The short term lethal effect is apparently due to oxygen deprivation as the body tries to safely oxidise the alcohol. However, alcohol via enema is also capable of causing extreme burning pain and cramps before the effects can kick in … Although you have been through so many horrible stomachaches due to your screwed up eating habits (and you could probably handle that kind of pain), this method would have to pass. You would not like more pain.</p>
<p>Heroine can work if you can get enough of it and do what you have to without getting caught. It turns off parts of your brain that control breathing.</p>
<p>Opioids like codeine can also work. Added with diphenhydramine and cyanide then injected, that could supposedly send you into deep sedation, which should be painless.</p>
<p>The entry on 29 Jan 1996 could help if you plan to buy some meds.</p>
<p>You can consider carbon monoxide. You could end up with muscle spasms and convulsions before going, but the gas is notorious for carrying people about painlessly. Apparently sodium formate and sulphuric acid reaction can be used to make some of the gas, as well as internal combustion engines. You can probably get the pure compressed gas somewhere if you search for it hard enough. People do consider the first two methods unreliable, as other gases can be produced in addition to the desired one, leading to insufficient concentrations of CO gas in the air (0.32% to 0.45% concentration in air can lead to unconsciousness in under an hour). Hm, 3-6% is supposedly enough to induce it rapidly. They say if you were to trap yourself in the garage with the car engine on, it would be nice to get an old junker, along with a CO monitor, the one with a digital scale. You should take painkillers in case of headaches and vomiting (motion sickness who?) Maintain at least 0.5% (5000 ppm) CO concentration … If you fail, you could end up brain damaged … Oops. Lawn mowers, boat engines, blower engines, hibachi might work as replacements for the car engine, it might be difficult to get a sufficient one due to the catalytic converters in modern ones.</p>
<p>You should take into account how all this is about 30 years ago, huh. But charcoal burners in well insulated rooms never get old though.</p><br>
<p>You rethink what you said earlier. Who said asphyxiation had to be via hanging? You can use ether, that thing in engine starting fluids. The purity might be put into question, but as long as you have enough in the bag (or a rag inside the bag, which is put over your head and secured), you should be able to drown. No, you should go with nitrogen or other inert gases, when introduced into an enclosed space the gas could displace oxygen in the air and carbon dioxide in your lungs. You would not feel breathless, you would just pass out and end. According to some, any welding store should have those huge tanks of nitrogen. You searched “nitrogen” online, you found a bunch of shops that sell the thing, a 34L tank costs about $200. Or you could use helium, the gas for balloons, a large 10L tank costs less than $100 on Amazon, and of course you could say that you get the tank for party balloons or something.</p>
<p>You should get a syphoning tube or any flexible tubing, according to some, 3m should be plenty enough while still being cheap. Then you should get a plastic tub, maybe a butter container, that could fit your chin and nose into the same space (or you could just get an air mask). Get the “I Can't Believe It's Not Butter!<sup>&#174;</sup>” margarine tubs, or any tub with strong plastic walls. Make a small indentation using a sharp knife for your nose, until the tub fits snugly. You should be able to keep it in place by sucking in the air in the tub. Get some elastic bands and use them to secure the tub mask until it fits comfortably, it does not have to be too tight. Then make two incisions with length equal to diameter of tubing (do not make a hole) in an “X” so as to slot the tubing inside. The plastic flap things from the incisions (resembling a flange) should be secured to the tubing with some tape so that the incision is air tight. The other side of the tubing should be connected to the nozzle of the helium tank. Some of them have a spring-loaded nozzle, so make sure to tie the nozzle to the handle of the tank so that you can keep the nozzle at one position for some time, enough for sufficient gas to enter your mask. Hold the nozzle so that it does not get pulled too far backwards, that will cause an extremely fast release of gas, the results will not be nice. Turn the gas on first, regulate the valves, then put the mask on, that would make your life (life?) a little more comfortable. The gas might be a little cold, but it is odourless, and your voice will sound absolutely like a soprano if you try hard enough. Enjoy yourself before it brings you away. Take slow deep breaths, calm down, do something, it would not be so long before you go. After 30 seconds, you should feel a little dizzy, but it is not uncomfortable, just a little pressure inside, you have been there before. You should keep your eyes shut so you would not have to contemplate your choices upon seeing the symptoms of oxygen deprivation kick in. You should be able to black out in less than 5 minutes. Do not panic, continue on, you can do it.</p>
<p>You can do it, of course, if you are not a coward; this has worked for more than 1 person. You have to go with this, otherwise you would never be able to really <i>commit</i>. Ending is difficult indeed, huh.</p>
<p>You have jumped down from a 3 meter stack of beds 3 times long ago, you should be able to do it, right? And yet sometimes you wonder why you are still here, thinking about all of It, when you could have passed 5 millennia ago.</p>
<p>You are quite the coward, huh? You plan to close the website. No point reading further, when you have nailed what you really want (to do). Of course you could always come back for better methods if you do not succeed in your first try. You could always try again, if you are quick witted enough to stop. You should be.</p>
<p lang="ja" xml:lang="ja">You oh so wish for euthanasia. Oh, how simple would that be! 自殺が楽しいはずないし~</p>
<p>Unfortunately, no, like everything in life, you should be brave, right? What is so awful about the other side, anyway? What are you scared of? What is there to do on this side? Why don’t you go to that side if you find yourself useless here? You could be more useful there, hell, you can even redeem yourself if you try hard enough (if you believe in reincarnation). You could be a wandering soul, not bounded by societal standards nor expectations (yourself). Wouldn’t that be nice? People will join you anyway, no?</p>
<p>If you care so little about this world, wouldn’t it be so nice to go to the other side, which you have been longing for? Pursue your dreams, they say. If you want it, you should commit to it. You even have a <b>suicide/guide/ </b>b> with you! You should, totally, totally, try it out some time.</p>
<p>You can even end it with      if you want.</p>
